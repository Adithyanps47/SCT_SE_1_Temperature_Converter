## 📋 Description
A modern, user-friendly desktop application built with Python and `CustomTkinter` that performs real-time temperature conversions. Unlike standard console scripts, this application features a fully responsive Graphical User Interface (GUI) with dark mode support.

This project was developed as part of the **SkillCraft Technology** internship program (Software Development Track).

## ✨ Features
* **Modern UI/UX:** Built with `CustomTkinter` for a professional, dark-themed aesthetic.
* **Universal Conversion:** Supports **Celsius**, **Fahrenheit**, and **Kelvin** scales.
* **Robust Error Handling:** graceful handling of non-numeric inputs prevents crashes.
* **User-Driven Design:** Clear layout with dropdown menus for easy selection.
